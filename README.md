# ScreenFetch-Windows
ScreenFetch for windows users made in powershell, because I wanted one.

Enable scripts on your machine in development tools and run in Powershell

```
	.\ScreenFetch.ps1
```

you can also set it to path. 
You can also hack the source code to change the color or the presentation of the items.
